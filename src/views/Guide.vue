    <div class="content">
      <h2>First contact</h2>
      <p>Use less work as possible, limit it to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Is it available?" or even better "available?"</li>
        <li>"150$?"</li>
        <li>"Location?"</li>
        <li><b>Never user any greetings</b></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Quantity over quality</h2>
      <p>You want to contact as much seller as possible, even if you are not really interested.<br>
      Always ask them few questions. And never give them any updates.</p>
      <h2>Don't show up</h2>
      <p>Ask when you can inspect the goods, set a time, and never go. It gives you a strong psychological advantage.</p>
      <h2>Be low</h2>
      <p>Keep in mind, if someone is advertising something for 300 dollars, there is few chances she/he might
        be keen to sell it for less than half of the given price, <b>TRY</b>.</p>
